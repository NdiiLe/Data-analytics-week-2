COMMON FILE FORMATS
TEXT FILE

Text files are widely used due to their ability to be opened on any platform without needing proprietary software. They are also known as flat files and are commonly used for storing machine-generated data like log entries. Delimiters, such as commas and tabs, separate data fields in structured text files. CSV files use commas as delimiters, while TSV files use tabs. Many software packages and coding languages support reading and writing delimited files, making it easy to work with structured data. Overall, text files are versatile and essential for storing and transmitting alphanumeric data in a variety of computing environments.
