STRUCTURED DATA
-Tabled
-stored in consistent, defined manner.
-organized into rows and columns.
All entries in a column contain the same type of value

UNSTRUCTURED DATA
-Qualitative, describes the characteristics of an event or an object.
-images, phrases, audio, video recordings and descriptive texts are examples of unstructured data.

SEMI STRUCTURED DATA
-It has a structure but it is not tabular. An example of a semi structured data is an email.

COMMON FILE FORMATS
TEXT FILE

Text files are widely used due to their ability to be opened on any platform without needing proprietary software. They are also known as flat files and are commonly used for storing machine-generated data like log entries. Delimiters, such as commas and tabs, separate data fields in structured text files. CSV files use commas as delimiters, while TSV files use tabs. Many software packages and coding languages support reading and writing delimited files, making it easy to work with structured data. Overall, text files are versatile and essential for storing and transmitting alphanumeric data in a variety of computing environments.

DATABASES & DATA ACQUISITION
RELATIONAL DATABASE
Relational databases are pieces of software that let you make an operational system out of an ERD. You start with a relational model and create a physical design. Relational entities correspond to database tables, and entity attributes correspond to table columns. 
When creating a database table, the ordering of columns does not matter because you can specify the column order when retrieving data from a table. When an attribute becomes a column, you assign it a data type. Completing all of this work results in a diagram known as a schema. You can think of a schema as an ERD with the additional details needed to create a database.

NON RELATIONAL DATABASE
A nonrelational database does not have a predefined structure based on tabular data. The result is a highly flexible approach to storing data. However, the data types available in relational databases are absent. As a result, you need to know more about the data itself to interact with it. Data validation happens in code, as opposed to being done in the database.

Examples of a none relational database are:

Key-Value
Document
